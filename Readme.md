Matlab code for semi-analytical solutions of the penny-shaped hydraulic fracture in consideration of fracture toughness, fluid viscosity, and fluid leak-off.

+ Reference: E.V. Dontsov, An approximate solution for a penny-shaped hydraulic fracture that accounts for fracture toughness, fluid viscosity and leak-off, Royal Society Open Science, 3 (2016) 160737.
+ The main program is PC_analytical_solution.m.
+ This code has been successfully tested using Matlab R2020b.
+ Parameters given in the main program are used for the verification example in the paper "An efficient XFEM-based approach for 3D hydraulic fracturing simulation considering crack front segmentation".
